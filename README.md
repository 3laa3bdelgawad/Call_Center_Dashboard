# Call Center Data Analysis and Visualization
## Overview:
The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize data from a call center in order to gain insights and improve operational efficiency. The project consists of three main components: data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization. By performing these tasks, we can uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics that will assist in making data-driven decisions and optimizing call center performance.

### 1- Data Cleaning:
In this phase, the raw data collected from the call center will be processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. The data cleaning process involves identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicate entries, resolving inconsistencies, and standardizing data formats. By ensuring data cleanliness, we enhance the reliability of subsequent analysis and visualization efforts.

### 2- Data Analysis:
Once the data has been cleaned, we perform a comprehensive analysis using pivot tables in Excel. The following key analyses have been conducted:

- Calls by Sentiment: Categorizes calls based on sentiment to identify patterns and trends in customer sentiment, helping address recurring issues and improve customer satisfaction.
- Sentiment by Call Center: Compares sentiment levels across different call centers, allowing us to identify if certain call centers consistently receive higher or lower sentiment ratings.
- Calls by Call Center: Provides an overview of call volumes handled by each call center, aiding resource allocation and workload management.
- Reason for Calls: Categorizes calls based on customer inquiries or complaints to identify common reasons and areas requiring support or process improvements.
- Response Time Range: Segments response times into ranges to assess distribution and identify bottlenecks or delays in addressing customer concerns.
- Response Time by Call Center: Compares response times across different call centers, helping identify best practices or areas for improvement.
- Calls by State: Categorizes calls based on geographic location, providing insights into regional call volumes and demographics.
### 3- Data Visualization:
To effectively communicate the findings and insights derived from the data analysis, we create visualizations using the pivot tables. Visualizations include charts, graphs, and dashboards in Excel to present the analyzed data in a meaningful way. Interactive visualizations enable stakeholders to comprehend complex information, spot trends, and identify areas requiring attention. These visual representations aid in making informed business decisions and facilitate effective communication of results.
